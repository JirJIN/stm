# STM (STate Manager)

## Note
I'll probably not be updating this as a separate repository now, it will just be included in jin

## Also (State, Table, Manager)
State Manager intended for games

States are stored on a stack.
Furthermore, states can store data that can be read/written to (read or read-write)
Real documentation will be coming when the jIN documentation is finished

It is a 1 header and 1 source library, so super easy to integrate to your project, and feel
free to customize it (and you probably will have to customize some functions anyways)

A nice todo would be to make an exporter program to export the files to the single header/source
but since it's super small I will just copy paste and make a few edits
